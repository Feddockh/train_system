## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a fully operational train simulation. The system will include software and hardware elements that will allow for a demonstration of a scheduling center, a control office, a train model, track and train controllers, as well as the necessary communications between different modules. The system will have user interfaces for each model that allow for input and interactions for all possible users.
