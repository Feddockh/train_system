"""
PLC program used to determine switch, crossing, and light state.
Representing a scenario where one train is going to Station B and
the other is going to Station C in that order. A crossing occurs at block 8.

Returns:
    switch(bool): Bool representing switch position - 0 = connected 
    6 & 1 = connected to 11. 
    crossing(bool): Bool representing crossing state - 0 = up & 1 = down
    light(bool): Bool representing light state - 0 = green & 1 = red
